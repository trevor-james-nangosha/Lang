# CRAFTING INTERPRETERS

This repo builds on the book `Crafting Interpreters` by *Robert Nystrom.*
In the book, we attempt to build a programming language from scratch, not just once but twice.

First, we get our hands dirty with a simpler implementation in Java and then later we build a performance oriented version in C.
Throughout this code, you will get a better understanding of parsers, syntax trees, lexical and type analysis, and also a bunch of
other core computer science concepts.

If all of this interests you, then I would suggest you read the book itself. I guarantee you will learn more from there. 

Let's go!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
